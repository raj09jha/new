I have Created 3 options in Expense Splitter -

SHOW
SHOW (Username)
EXPENSE(Add the user expense via EQUAL)

-for SHOW : No Input Required just SHOW and it will provide the balance Sheet. Output will be when some balances are 

Krish owes 3333.34 to Ajay
Kumar owes 3333.33 to Ajay
Ram owes 3333.33 to Ajay

Otherwise it will give no balances
            

-for SHOW (Username) : Provide User name as input (example - Kumar) and Output will be

Kumar owes 3333.33 to Ajay

Otherwise it will give no balances

-for EXPENSE(Add the user expense via EQUAL) : Input will be first EXPENSE then you have to write the expense detail input as 
Rent 10000 Ajay EQUAL

It will save the name as Rent amout as 10000 username will be Ajay and the command will be EQUAL.

In this code you can add as many Expense and when you enter the command show it will give you balance sheet.
